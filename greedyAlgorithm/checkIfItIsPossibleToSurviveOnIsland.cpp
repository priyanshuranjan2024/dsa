// You are a person on an island. There is only one shop in this island, this shop is open on all days of the week 
// except for Sunday. Consider following constraints: 


// S – Number of days you are required to survive.

// N – Maximum unit of food you can buy each day.

// M -  Unit of food required each day to survive.


// Currently, it’s Monday, and you need to survive for the next S days. 


// Find the minimum number of days on which you need to buy food from the shop so that you can survive the 
// next S days, or determine that it isn’t possible to survive.
