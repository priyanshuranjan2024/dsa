data structures needed-visited set,priority_queue<pair>,unordered map

//process
1.insert <-1,src> in pq;
2.one by one remove root elements from the pq;
3.if root elements is already visited then just continue
4.otherwise we mark the root element as visited
5.we store the wt of pair in the answer
6.update the mapping
7.go to every neighbour of the current node at only add those node that are unvisited and have a better weight proposition.
